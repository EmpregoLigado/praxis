## Guidelines
- Always write in complete sentences. Every complete English sentence has a
  subject, object and verb. These can sometimes be implied, but if you have any
  doubts, be explicit.
- Be economical in your sentence structure. Reference is boring. People want to
  quickly find what they're looking for and leave. Don't bury the information
  under a bunch of pointless words. If you can remove words without changing
  your meaning, while preserving or even improving readability, do it!
- Write from first person plural perspective (we, us, our, etc)
- Write to second person singular (you, you, your, etc)
- Avoid long sentences with lots of embedded clauses, or you may win the
  [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002621.html](Trent
  Reznor Prize). If your sentence has multiple pairs of parenthesis or many
  confusing commas, break it up into simpler sentences.
- For examples, use the imperative mood, unless you want to emphasize
  optionality or some other interesting perspective: "Create a praxis app by
  running..." instead of "You can create a praxis app by running..."
- Never use lists or sub-lists that contain only a single item
- Examples should be directed at the reader not at ourselves: "To build a
  Praxis app, start by designing the API" instead of "To build a Praxis app, we
  start by designing the API."
- Shell commands to run as a regular user should use the '$' prefix, and to run
  as root use the '#' prefix.
- Prefer active voice when it makes sense
  - "Praxis generates an example application." instead of "An example
    application is generated."
  - "You can view the API specification through the API browser application."
    instead of "The API specification can be viewed through the API browser
    application."
  - "what the application will actually do when it runs" instead of "what the
    application will actually do when it is run"
- Starting a sentence with a conjunction is OK, especially if you can break
  up a large sentence into more legible chunks
- Avoid "filler" words like "well", "now", "so then", "of course", "alright
  then" when they have no meaningful impact
- Avoid unnecessary interjections of the word 'that'. 'specification of the API
  you have defined' instead of 'specification of the API that you have defined'
- Capitalize all HTTP verbs (all caps)
- Use the Oxford comma in lists: 'one, two, and three' instead of 'one, two and
  three'
- Spell out integers zero through nine, but use numerals for integers 10 and
  over.
- Title-case headings at levels one and two, sentence-case lower level headings
- Ending a sentence with a preposition isn't the devil, but try not to do it
  too much
