    <p>Field Selectors allow you to specify in a request exactly what data you
      wish to recieve in the response. This allows the client to get an efficient
      response with only the fields required.</p>
    <p>The fields can come from the endpoint ºs associated Schema, or from an
      attribute exposed in any of the views of the resource. Multiple fields are
      separated by commas.</p>
    <p>You can also select properties from nested schemas from parent schema
      using curly braces. For example <code>title,user{name,email}</code> would lead to a
      response like this:</p>
    <pre>{
  "title": "Nice Blog Post",
  "user": {
    "name": "John Appleseed",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
}</pre>
    <p>If you do not specify attributes of nested properties, the <code>default</code>
      view will be used to render them.</p>
